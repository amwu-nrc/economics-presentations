## Productivity and Management

Productivity is primarily determined by five things:

-   The health and skills of workers

-   Physical capital like tools, and machines

-   Technology and innovation

-   Management of resources

## Productivity and Public Policy

Policy levers available to grow/improve productivity

-   Health

-   Skills

-   Investment

-   Environmental regulation

-   Managerial practices

## Productivity in the Workplace

> A wage increase isn't affordable this year because productivity is stagnant

-   This is often a lie but even if it is true - who is responsible for stagnant productivity? Worker or Boss?

## Productivity in the Workplace - Health

-   Are workers earning enough to live without constant stress?
-   Are workplace health and safety risks properly addressed?
-   Do workers have sufficient time to rest and recover?

## Productivity in the Workplace - Skills

-   Are workers given opportunities to develop their skills and advance their careers?

-   Does the company cover training costs? Or offer time off?

-   Are there incentives to train?

## Productivity in the Workplace - Investment

-   Is the company investing in physical capital and research?

-   Are workers provided with the tools and materials they need to be productive?

-   Is time wasted on non-value adding tasks?

-   Can workers raise and resolve issues with management?

-   Are workers deployed effectively?

## Productivity in the Workplace

-   Productivity in the workplace is shaped by the choices companies make

-   Companies can be profitable without being productive.

-   Workers need to be able to discuss productivity openly so they can challenge misleading claims.
