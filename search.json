    "text": "Inflation: Discussion\n\nContext\nInflation, under neo-liberalism has become the single most important economic priority.\nThis coincides with the increased dominance and ‘importance’ of the financial industry and the decline in productive industry like manufacturing.\nControlling inflation is More Important than:\n\nfull employment\nreducing inequality\nhousing affordability\nalleviating poverty\n\nInstead of full employment, government and institutions now push the “non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment” which suggests there is a minimum level of unemployment necessary in order to stop wages growth and rising inflation. Of course, we can’t measure the NAIRU, only show that it might exist, if a bunch of assumptions are made about how the economy works. Estimates from data suggest that it falls somewhere between 4 and 5%.\nThis means that it is explicit government policy to keep up-to 5% of the labour force out of work, in order to keep wages and inflation down.\nSuch policy MIGHT be palatable if there was a strong social safety net to support workers who lose their job and are looking for another one. Of course, we don’t even get that, with only the below poverty JobSeeker payment available.\nBut it is still a very inefficient use of the labour power that our economy has access to. Why shouldn’t someone who wants to work not have access to a job? It also means that policy is designed to discipline labour.\nWhich by the way, is why the budget in 2024, by the nominative party of labour, forecast that the plan was to tackle inflation by driving the unemployment rate UP to at least 4.5 percent by June 2025. Last weeks unemployment figures showed that unemployment unexpectedly had increased to 4.2%. It would be cold comfort for those who find themselves recently unemployed that they’re doing their part to combat inflation and keep wages down!\n\n\nWhy do economists care about inflation?\nWhat is inflation measuring?\nWhat does a decrease in inflation mean?\nHow does the video match your experience?"

    "text": "Productivity: Discussion\n\nProductivity is possibly the most misunderstood economic indicator, but simultaneously one of the most spoken about. The newly elected government has set its focus on productivity, and productivity growth, and has got the Productivity Commission in on the action.\nThe Productivity Commission by the way, should be seen as a complete joke. It was created by the Howard government in the 1990s, and sits within the Treasury department.\nIn a FWC hearing in 2025, the chief economist of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (also a joke) was asked “what factors drove productivity”. He answered that “the Productivity Commission was currently examining those factors”. 35 years since their establishment, and the Productivity Commission is still examining what productivity even is!!!\nAs an example of how productivity is misunderstood, here’s a quote from the Australian Constructors Association (an industry group):\n\nIf we stay stuck on the current course, our living standards will go backward, with Australians working longer hours for less money.\n\nProductivity has nothing to do with wages - and working longer hours contributes to decreasing productivity, not the other way around!!\nAs an aside, one of the ways to increase productivity in the construction industry would be to reform the apprentice system, pay higher wages, and encourage more people to become skilled tradespeople.\nOpen the room to discussion on the dot points\nProductivity is about quantities, and not about costs. Its the rate at which we produce goods or services per unit of input. How many workers does it take to make a widget?\nProductivity is also about technological progress. If a new technology enables the production of the same number of goods in fewer man-hours, that increases productivity. But these are the decisions of management, not the decisions of workers.\nMeasuring productivity is really hard. Output per worker-hour in industries which make a single output (like a car) is straightforward. But what about the interaction between capital and worker? How can you measure the output per capital-worker-hour? What does that even mean?\nSpeaking of the Productivity Commission, their report into productivity identified that estimates of productivity are constantly being revised - sometimes by 0.5 percentage points or more. The June quarter estimate of productivity growth was 0.5%. There is a huge potential for error - there’s a big difference between 0%, 0.5%, and 1.0%.\nEstimates of productivity in non-market sectors like education, or health care, are even more ridiculous. What is the output you’re measuring? Number of students graduating? Number of patients discharged? If that’s the case, productivity would go up by reducing the number of teachers or the number of nurses.\nFinally, real wages and productivity decoupled long ago. Increased productivity no longer translates with increases in real wages. That means that private business is getting more output per unit of input, but they are not passing that on to the workers who actually supply their labour. Instead, productivity growth contributes to increasing worker exploitation through increased profit margins. How that profit is spent is then up to the capitalist, not the worker.\n\n\nWhy do economists care about productivity?\nWhat is productivity measuring?\nWho benefits from increased productivity?\nWhat factors influence how productive you feel at work?"

Statistical agencies have to make a lot of decisions when calculating price indices, including:\n\nWhat goes into the basket?\nHow should like items be grouped?\nHow should each group be weighted into the overall?\nHow often should the weighting change?\n\nUltimately, the basket of goods and services does not represent the spending or expenditure patterns of any one individual. There will be a disconnect between how the CPI is reported, and how you feel it as an individual. That doesn’t mean your feelings are wrong, or that you’re spending money ‘incorrectly’. It also means that we should not accept pay rises equal to changes in the CPI.\nNote that I specified housing as a good/service that is included in the consumer price index. What would you expect that to measure? The cost of housing is measured as the price of a new home (excluding land). Mortgage payments are excluded.\n\n\nThe CPI is a measure of changes in the price of a “basket” of goods and services.\nThe basket includes (among other things):\n\nFood and non-alcoholic beverages, alcohol and tobacco and housing\n\nIt represents the average inflation experience - and is not reflective of changes in cost of living."

It isn’t particularly worrisome if the price of everything doubles but your income also doubles.\nUnfortunately it’s not really that easy to tell if this is happening or not.\nDoes it feel to you that things are more expensive relative to how much your earning?\nBecause the CPI is measured using a basket of goods, which is supposed to represent the ‘average’ consumer, it is guaranteed that your experience is different - because you buy different things in different proportions than the “representative” consumer.\nBut we can look at the “real” value of wages - how far their purchasing power goes. And here we have another trick of the economist. How do you convert “nominal” dollars - how much you earn today (or yesterday) into “real” dollars - how much does that dollar buy you?\nDifferent economists will use different “deflators” to convert nominal dollars into real dollars. The one they choose will often be the one that tells the story they want to tell. They can trick by setting the index at a different point in time.\nWhether we compare wage increases with increases in the CPI, or increases in the cost of living, it is clear that wages today are worth only about as much as they were in 2010/11."

It is a social science, not a hard science. There is no Nobel prize in economics (the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was not and is not one of the original 5).\nEarly economics was philosophical - looking at questions like:\n\nWhat is work? What is production?\nWhat is value?\n\nIn the 1600s, the dominant ideology of Britain was mercantilism, based on the growing power of Britain, and the vast trade networks they had developed through colonialism. The economics of the time was a reflection of this ideology, highlighting the ways in which trade was important for a country’s economic development. Economists argued for increased power of the state (to strengthen colonial power) and for government’s to maintain a trade surplus.\nIn France, about 100 years later, the physiocrats considered two distinct industries - agricultural, and non-agricultural, in reflection of the growing industrialisation in workshops and of artisans. The physiocrats believed that only agricultural labour could create value in the products of society, and that non-agricultural labour was unproductive.\n\nDespite what economists would have you believe:\n\nEconomics is not an independent, neutral, or technical system\nEconomics is inherently linked to political ideology.\nYou can’t eat “headline inflation fell to 2.4%”"

    "text": "Political Economy - Modern Economics\n\nClassical Economics\nPrior to and during the industrial revolution, classical economics was developed, primarily through Adam Smith - advancing the theory of the divisibility of labour - that it is more productive for individuals to specialise in one part of the creation of a product, rather than the whole chain. Again - the economics is reflective of the political - increased work in factories, industrial revolution, factory work. Adam Smith is seen by some as the guy who invented free market economics. But Smith was strongly opposed to monopolies, and recognised the importance of class, compared to individual.\nSome ideas have lasted longer than others. Smith’s division of labour is still popular today. Others, like Malthus who argued that any wages greater than that required to subside would fuel unstable population growth that absorbed any real income growth, have mostly died out.\nRicardo invented a theory of free trade which said that all economies are made better off by specialising in the industry they have comparative advantage which is only true in theory - but is still trotted out by free market advocates today.\nMarxism was a response to the conditions under which labour was treated during the industrial period - long hours, terrible conditions, high death rates, child labour etc, as well as the growing and obvious disaprities in wealth between the owners of capital, and those who had to work for a living. One insight from Marxism about capitalism is “the tendency for the rate of profit to fall”, which says basically, over time, the rate of profit to the amount of invested capital decreases over time. I think that such a theory explains a lot about the development of capitalism and economics since the 1900s.\nNeoclassical\nFocus on the individual, and equilibrium in markets. Bring in mathematics and models to try and answer economic questions. Neoclassical theories are based on abstract ideas, rather than the visible realities. Stuff like:\n\nEveryone is born with some endowment of labour power, skill, or another resource.\nEveryone is born with a set of preferences which determine what they like to consume.\nTechnology converts endowments into usable goods and services.\nTrading through markets makes sure that everything is optimal.\n\nWhich leads to the conclusion that:\n\nthe market fixes everything and;\nprofit represents the productivity of owned capital - and it is morally justifiable - just explain away the exploitation.\n\nBrief interlude with Keynesianism (explicitly a response to the great depression)- the situation won’t resolve itself, and government can stop unemployment by boosting demand (govt spending, taxation, interest rates)\nBut the return in the 1970s of neoclassical economics (explicitly a response to the stagflation of the 1970s), consolidated today as neoliberalism returns us back to the market solving everyone’s problems.\nThe most important message is:\n\nEconomics reflects the the political ideology, not the other way around!\nEconomists (as social scientists) have ideas about ways that the economy should function\n\n\n\n“Classical” economics is associated with the development of capitalism and the industrial revolution in the late 1700 and early 1800s.\nMarxism was a response to the horrible working conditions under which labour was subjected during the industrial revolution - and the associated disparity between capital class and working class."

But profit itself is not a productive activity - but a social relationship between owner, worker, and capital. Profit can be used to re-invest into more capital - and this was the fundamental driver of capitalism during the industrial revolution. Productivity increases from the increased division of labour rapidly increased profits. SOME of these profits were re-invested into production - both to maintain machinery, and to improve processes. Of course, some of the profits were consumed by the ‘capitalist fat cat’ - which is why they’re always depicted as such during this period.\n\n\nEverything in the economy comes from some combination of work and the natural environment, but only work can “add value”\nThere have been many attempts to define value - but clearly productive labour is the only source of it.\nCapital is not inherently ‘productive’, despite being paid profit."

Most households were proletarian or “working class” and the bosses were the bourgeois or capitalist class.\n\nSee: the Simpsons nuclear power plant.\n\nThis period coincides with strong trade union membership, a strong sense of working class identity, and a strong understanding of the power that existed in its collectivism.\nThe theoretical underpinning behind class is rooted in the relationship between individual and the means of production. If you didn’t own the equipment which made the product you were working class.\nBeyond the theoretical (or economical), there are social elements to class as well - including culture, pastimes, institutions, even where you live.\nPost the 1960s, the decline in mining, construction, and manufacturing resulted in a change in the structure of the economy - away from manual work, and towards clerical, administrative, and supervisory work - the white collar. Advances in technology further resulted in increases in technician or supervisory, foreman style work at the expense of manual labour.\nRatio of services output to manufacturing output.\nThis has had a huge impact on trade union density.\nJust as the capitalist today is aesthetically different from the factory owner of the industrial revolution, so too has the working class changed.\nMarx defined class as a relationship between individual and the means of production.

Unlike in the industrial revolution, the company owner is unlikely to be on the factory floor - patrolling and keeping everyone in line. The modern capitalist tries to trade on the aesthetics of the working class.\nThe concentration of wealth among the capital class however, has only increased since the industrial age. More and more wealth is held by fewer and fewer people. Owning shares, or investing in a mutual fund, does not make you a member of the capitalist class.\n\n\nIncome InequalityWealth Inequality"
