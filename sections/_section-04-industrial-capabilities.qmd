# Industrial Capabilities

> What you make is what you know

## Industrial Capabilities

-   Core concepts:
    -   a country makes (or does) what it knows
    -   products (or activities) represent combinations of knowledge
-   Capabilities are like letters in Scrabble
    -   The more you have, the more words you can make
    -   Rare letters create words worth more points

## Measuring Industrial Capabilities

-   Export data reveals what a country makes
-   Comparison between countries reveals which capabilities are common, and which are rare
-   The presence of different capabilities in different countries allows a ranking called the Economic Complexity Index

## Why Does It Matter?

-   The Economic Complexity Index is predictive of the direction of future economic growth.
    -   Countries with higher complexity are predicted to grow faster
-   Useful tool to identify productive capabilities of a country.
-   Can be used to identify future opportunities and direct strategy.

## Why Does It Matter to Australia?

::: notes
-   Australia's ranking in 2023 was 105th - Sandwiched between Botswana and CÃ´te d'Ivoire
-   Australia's exports are concentrated in only a few products
-   Australia's exports are lower in average complexity
-   Australia does not have the industrial capabilities of other developed countries.

## What Can Be Done?

::: notes
The problem:

-   is real, will not be solved by the market and will not be solved with small tweaks and adjustments.
:::

-   Recognise that there is a problem.

-   The lack of sufficient existing capabilities requires explicit and direct industrial policy.

-   Understand the connection between just transition, decarbonisation, and reindustrialisation.

-   Develop a policy agenda which explicitly outlines existing and future opportunities, and how to get there.
